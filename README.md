# spam_ham_email_classification

Overview

This project is a machine learning-based spam email classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify emails as spam or not spam by extracting features from the email's text and applying machine learning algorithms. It leverages NLP for text preprocessing and various classification algorithms to achieve high accuracy.

Features

Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Machine Learning Models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression.
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
Visualization: Visualizations of results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
